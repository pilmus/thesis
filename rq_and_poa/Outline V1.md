## MAIN
- Abstract

- Introduction
	- Toy example

- Part one: Replication
	- Methodology
		- FairTrec
			- Task
			- Dataset
			- Metrics
		- Previous approaches

	- Experiments
		- How do we do the experiments?
		- Trec_eval equivalent for sequence of rankings

	- Results


	- Analysis
		- Where are the most errors? Why?

- Part two: Improvement
	- Literature survey algorithmic causal fairness
		- ML as a whole
		- Ranking specifically
		
	- Proposed improvement
		- Which CF approach most likely to yield an improvement for the FairTrec task? Why?

	- Experiments
	- Results
	- Analysis + discussion




- Background
	- Fairness in ML, fairness in ranking




- Conclusion
