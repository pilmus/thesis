# Talking points
- Have created some results: random roughly the same, Lamdamart was lower util but also lower unfairness

- 8 Approaches 2020, 5 in 2019
- At least 4 search enginges: ES, Terrier, SOLR, DynamoDB, one currently unknown
- 
- Currently: thinking about how to do error analysis on a sequence of DIFFERENT queries
- Also: index data in Terrier to replicate the results from the Terrier team

- Next up: make planning with the remaining time and send to Claudia to see if thinks it's realistic...
