# [[Â§The tasks]]
FairTrec is a TREC track that was first organized in 2019. The goal of the track is to improve fair ranking algorithms by providing a dataset and metrics.

At the time of writing this thesis, the overview papers of FairTrec 2019[^1] and FairTrec 2020[^2] are available. 

FairTrec 2019 had one task: re-ranking
FairTrec 2020 had two tasks: retrieval and re-ranking. The re-ranking task is identical to the 2019 one. In light of limited resources this is also the track we focus on.

At time of writing FairTrec 2021 is also being pulbished. It again has a re-ranking task that is suitable for comparison so we may incorporate that also.
