Code to reproduce your TREC [YEAR] Fair Ranking Track runs

Dear [NAME],

I am a master student in Computer Science at Delft University of Technology. I am writing my master thesis on fair information retrieval and specifically the potential applicability of causal fairness notions to fair IR. I am using the TREC 2019 & 2020 Fair Ranking Tasks as a reference.  
  
As part of my research I am conducting an error analysis on previous runs for the TREC 2019 & 2020 Fair Ranking Tasks. I saw that your team submitted runs [INSERT WHEN]. However, I was unable to find any code you may have used online. Would it be possible for you to share your code so that I may analyze your approach?  
  
Thank you in advance!  
  
Kind regards,
